	  <h2>Party Guidelines</h2>
	        CossiePlay party-goers party at their own risk and are responsible for their own safety<br>
	        Check with your doctor before you party hard
	        Party fees must be paid at the door (Cash or EFTPOS accepted).<br>
	        Credit card payments attract a 2% surcharge<br>
	        Alcohol is served at the bar to over 18s only<br>
	        No intoxicated persons will be served, but will be escorted to a taxi – paid by the party-goer.
